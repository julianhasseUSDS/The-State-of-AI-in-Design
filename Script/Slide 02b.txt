[Demystifying AI]

Almost all the progress we are seeing in AI today is artificial narrow intelligence.
These are AIs that do one thing such as a smart speaker, a self-driving car, AI to do web search or AI applications in farming and factories. These types of AI are one-trick ponies but when you find the appropriate trick, this can be incredibly valuable.
Unfortunately, AI also refers to a second concept of AGI or artificial general intelligence.

They can do anything a human can do or maybe even more things than any human can. This is also known as "super intelligence"), and we are not there yet.

When will we get there?
