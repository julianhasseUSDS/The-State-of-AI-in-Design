[Midjourney examples]


Let's say I'm working on the layout of an article about President Kennedy and need to include an image to illustrate the author's point of view.

First I try "President Kennedy realistic Pixar character  -- ar 1:1", and I get these four images.

Perhaps I could leverage a "keyword" that I saw on the article, where the author mentioned The Simpsons as a cultural reference.

Or even better, I could relate to the keyword "fragmentation" and apply cubism style to the image.

Finally I upscale the image I like and place it on my layout.

But perhaps there is a simpler way of designing?
