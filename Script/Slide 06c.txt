[Non-technical explanation of deep learning]

The terms deep learning and neural network are used almost interchangeably in AI.
And even though they're great for machine learning, there's also been a bit of hype and bit of mystique about them.

In order to understand what they are let's use an example from demand prediction.

Let's say you run a website that sells t-shirts, and you want to know, based on how you price the t-shirts, how many units you expect to sell.

You might then create a dataset like this, where the higher the price of the t-shirt, the lower the demand. 

So you might fit a straight line to this data, showing that as the price goes up, the demand goes down.

Now demand can never go below zero, so maybe you say that the demand will flatten out at zero, and beyond a certain point you expect pretty much no one to buy any t-shirts.

It turns out this blue line is maybe the simplest possible neural network.
You have as input the price, A, and you want it to output the estimated demand, B.

So the way you would draw this as a neural network is that the price will be input to this little round thing there, and this little round thing outputs the estimated demand.

In the terminology of AI, this little round thing here is called a neuron, or sometimes it's called an artificial neuron, and all it does is compute this blue curve that I've drawn here on the left.
This is maybe the simplest possible neural network with a single artificial neuron, that just inputs the price and outputs the estimated demand.
