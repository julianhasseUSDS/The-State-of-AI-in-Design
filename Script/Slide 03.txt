[When will we get there?]

Hardware power (how much useful work a computer does per unit time) is commonly measured in terms of floating point operations per second or FLOP/s. Larger models run on hardware that performs more FLOP/s. Researchers use floating point operations or FLOP to measure total computation; a “FLOP” is equivalent to one addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two decimal numbers. Training a larger model generally takes more total FLOP.


In "The Lifetime Anchor hypothesis", Dr. Ajeya Cotta estimates that a median of "1 times 10 to the 29" FLOP will be required to represent the amount of FLOP done in a human lifetime. Similarly, she estimates a median of "1 times 10 to the 41" FLOP will be required to represent the amount of FLOP done over the course of evolution. 

These numbers allow us to project that we will be able to acquire full AGI by the year 2100.
