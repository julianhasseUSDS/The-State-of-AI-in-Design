[who owns the future]


Last month, artist Kelly McKernan joined a class-action lawsuit with two other artists, Sarah Andersen and Karla Ortiz, against Midjourney and two other AI imagery generators, Stable Diffusion and DreamUp. All three models make use of laion-5B, a nonprofit, publicly available database that indexes more than five billion images from across the Internet, including the work of many artists. 

The alleged wrongdoing comes down to what I summarize as “the three ‘C’s”: 

1. The artists had not consented to have their copyrighted artwork included in the laion database
2. They were not compensated for their involvement, even as companies including Midjourney charged for the use of their tools
3.and their influence was not credited when A.I. images were produced using their work. 

When producing an image, these generators “present something to you as if it’s copyright free,” the claim states, adding that every image a generative tool produces “is an infringing, derivative work.”
