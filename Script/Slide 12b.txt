[Midjourney prompt]


This is what a Midjourney prompt looks like.

You always start by using the /imagine command, followed by the text prompt (description of what to imagine). This will create a grid of 4 images which you can upscale or create variations.

Optionally you can pass parameters (--ar is aspect ratio, --q is quality, and so on and so forth).
You can also use an existent image as a based, in which case you can pass the image url first.

Now, Letâ€™s see Midjourney in action!
